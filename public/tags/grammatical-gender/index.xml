      <description>Learning a second language is hard, but some aspects of a second language are more challenging to master than others. Grammatical gender is one of these things. Adult second language learners in particular have a very difficult time learning the grammatical gender of words and being able to use grammatical gender consistently in comprehension and in production. I want to know why. To that end, I have been conducting research aimed at identifying what factors make grammatical gender so difficult for adults to learn and use in a second language.</description>
