However, these regressions are implemented with an algorithm which may not converge on a solution. While convergence issues in linear mixed effects models can often be addressed with careful experiment design and model building, logistic mixed effects models introduce the possibility of separation or quasi-separation, which can cause problems for model estimation that result in convergence errors or in unreasonable model estimates. These problems cannot be solved by experiment or model design. In this paper, we discuss (quasi-)separation with the language researcher in mind, explaining what it is, how it causes problems for model estimation, and why it can be expected in linguistic datasets. Using real linguistic datasets, we then show how Bayesian models can be used to overcome convergence issues introduced by quasi-separation, whereas frequentist approaches fail. On the basis of these demonstrations, we advocate for the adoption of Bayesian models as a practical solution to dealing with convergence issues when modeling binary linguistic data.","tags":[],"title":"Confronting quasi-separation in logistic mixed effects for linguistic data: A Bayesian approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Shantz, K.**","Tanner, D."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514761200,"objectID":"535eef52bba2fc0d0f599de7e170753b","permalink":"/publication/no-inherent-delay/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/no-inherent-delay/","section":"publication","summary":"Late second language (L2) learners experience pervasive difficulty mastering grammatical gender, and a comprehensive account of this deficit has yet to emerge.

The magnitude of grammaticality effects for native speakers did not differ by phrase frequency, indicating that phrase frequency does not modulate native grammatical processing. Phrase frequency did, however, modulate the magnitude of non-native grammaticality effects. This modulating effect of phrase frequency on grammatical processing for non-native speakers depended on proficiency, showing a u-shaped change in the size of grammaticality effects relative to speaker proficiency. The overall pattern of change in grammaticality effects suggests a gradual developmental shift in grammatical processing from an initial reliance on phrase frequency to an eventual abstraction of generalizable rules from the linguistic input once sufficient experience has accumulated.

Recent research has further suggested that these difficulties stem from processing problems rather than basic learnability problems: even high proficiency speakers routinely produce errors and show difficulty using gender-marked determiners to anticipate upcoming nouns, despite knowing nouns’ genders (e.g., Grüter et al., 2012). The cognitive locus of this difficulty, however, remains unknown. To address this, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate potential processing-based loci for these difficulties, focusing on the relative time course of retrieval of gender and phonology information during lexical retrieval. Based on L1 production research showing a timing advantage for retrieving gender versus phonological information (Van Turennout et al., 1998), we hypothesized that L2 processing difficulties may stem partly from delayed access of gender, relative to a word’s phonological code. Native German speakers (N=20) and native speakers of English who were proficient in L2 German (N=20) performed a covert picture naming task based on that used by Van Turennout et al. Participants viewed images of high frequency German nouns, and made decisions based on the grammatical gender (masculine or neuter) and initial phone (/b/ or /k/) of each noun. In a fully counterbalanced, within-subjects design, participants used one source of information (gender or phonology) to determine whether or not to press a button on a response pad, and the other source of information to determine which button to press in the case of a go-trial (left or right). Previous research using this paradigm has found that the relative timing of lexical information retrieval is sensitive to retrieval difficulty, showing delays as difficulty increases (e.g., Abdel Rahman \u0026 Sommer, 2003). We therefore adopted this paradigm to obtain a fine-grained estimate of the time course of gender information access in L2 populations. ERP analysis focused on the N200 component, which indexes response inhibition and has been used to provide an upper-bound estimate of the time at which lexical information is accessed in go/no-go tasks (cf. Schmitt et al., 2000). Results showed larger N200 effects for no-go versus go trials, but no significant differences in N200 peak latency for go/no-go decisions based on gender compared to phonology in native or non-native German speakers. Importantly, data also showed no delay in mean latency for the non-native German speakers (M=423.8 ms, sd=0.9) relative to native speakers (M=431.6, sd=10.7). First, our native speaker results do not replicate Van Turennout et al.’s lateralized readiness potential results: there was no evidence of earlier access to grammatical gender information compared to phonological information, suggesting that the gender-before-phonology information flow may not generalize to all situations. Second, the lack of any delay in access to grammatical gender information for the L2 population suggests that the difficulties experienced by L2 learners with grammatical gender cannot be directly tied to delays in the timing of gender access during online processing. Our results thus provide important constraints for theories of grammatical gender use and lexical access in L2 production.","tags":[],"title":"Are L2 learners pressed for time?

These models can be robust, useful and statistically valid when used appropriately. However, a mixed effects regression is implemented with an algorithm, which may not converge on a solution. When convergence fails, researchers may be forced to abandon a model that matches their theoretical assumptions in favor of a model that converges. We argue that the current state of the art of simplifying models in response to convergence errors is not based in good statistical practice, and show that this may lead to incorrect conclusions. We propose implementing mixed effects models in a Bayesian framework. We give examples of two studies in which the maximal mixed effects models justified by the design do not converge, but fully specified Bayesian models with weakly informative constraints do converge. We conclude that a Bayesian framework offers a practical--and, critically, a statistically valid--solution to the problem of convergence errors.","tags":[],"title":"Beyond maximal random effects for logistic regression: Moving past convergence problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
